      physics hobbyist and amateur enthusiast. pursuing cosmology phd (applying soon). my interest is in static redshift models, i think leaving out expansion and inflation (or recharacterizing them as dynamic gravity) might be a promising avenue to new physics. this is the "modified newtonian dynamics" corner of physics, although i prefer broader terms like modified gravity. i try to keep up with CERN, neutrino observatories, and LIGO.
