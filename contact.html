      my music copyrights are generally creative commons attribution non-commercial. if you'd like to remix or interpolate my work, feel free! please include credit and send me a link. if you'd like isolated stem tracks, or want to collaborate, send me a message.
    </p>
    <p>
      my music is available for sync licensing and commercial placement. if you typically send inquiries through cdbaby, ascap, or songtrust, most of my music can be found there. if it's easier to inquire directly via email, feel free to do so.

      please let me know if you find any broken links, improperly attributed samples, or site breakage (screenshot/display size/browser type might help me figure those out). thanks!
