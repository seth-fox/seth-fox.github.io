      this album and pilot wave were bundled as a compilation for distribution (because it seemed more economical at the time), they are availalbe on streaming services under the name "is this thing on?"

      it is named after the marina abramoviÄ‡ fundraiser controversy. in retrospect it's getting hard for me to believe there was a time i thought this was funny, but there was a time i thought the possibility of another christian extremist satanic panic, as a bid for political power, was absurd. i mean it <i>was</i> absurd, both now and in the 80s. i'm from utah so i'm accustomed to christians using religion for power like this, but it was fatiguing to see it metastasize on the national scale. i'm kind of left feeling like i participated in an early version (gayle ruzicka's eagle forum) of the extremism that eventually became a viable political movement (amy coney barrett). i don't know what i can say to prevent it from metastasizing further, except that i've seen what's down at the bottom of that well and there's nothing there.
