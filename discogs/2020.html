      bit of a weird one. 78 thirty-second tracks. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/setfox/snacks" target="_blank">soundcloud</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwrYN_d0lec" target="_blank">youtube</a> are probably best (for gapless playback), but my idea was originally that it should be shuffled. it's also available on bandcamp, but being as it was, weird, it was rejected for distribution by all three major distributors (cdbaby, tunecore, distrokid... distrokid actually said "these are not real songs" in an email. very funny. actually, you know what, to be fair, cdbaby said they would do it if i got it pressed as a CD first, but i never did that.)
