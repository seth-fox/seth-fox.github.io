      my current project, available on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/setfox" target="_blank">soundcloud.</a> usually i release tracks close to realtime, shortly after they are written, & then rework the best ones for release. this time i'm trying to make a very large batch. finished tracklist may be somewhat different. i won't really know what i was going for until it's done.

      i have not been using neural networks or midi generators so far, except in the sense that the mimu glove can generate midi, & its software does use a neural network (to identify hand positions) -- but the software is not making choices for me, in the sense that i usually mean when i invoke those terms.
