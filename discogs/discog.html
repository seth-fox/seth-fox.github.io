    <p>
      these pages contain some background on the ideas behind each of the albums i've put together, what i was thinking about and working with at the time. you know, liner notes. i'd like to add some scrapbook photos of the places i was living when i made these, or what i looked like at the time, but it will take a bit of digging for me to put those together.

      most of my work is made in <a href="https://ableton.com/" target="_blank">ableton,</a> and about half of it it using a <a href="https://www.yamaha.com/en/about/design/synapses/id_005" target="_blank">yamaha tenori-on.</a> each album is usually made by working with some type of code-based midi generator freeware. people variously call these machine learning algorithms or neural networks or artificial intelligence, but some of the midi generators i've used are much simpler.
